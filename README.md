# Hallo-World
Happy's first step at GitHub "Hallo World".
Happy is a come back from structured programming. I am now more intrested to open source; and independent programming. I am hungry for a practical platform. Unfortunately I learnt theory of all languages interesting to me about a year ago.I am only able to start at Github now. But I hope to learn a lot.
