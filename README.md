Happy's first step at GitHub "Hallo World".
Happy is a come back from structured programming. More now intrested to open source and independent programming. I am hungry for a practical platform. Unfortunately I all learnt theory of most languages interesting in me about a year ago.I am only able to start at Github now. But I hope to learn a lot.
